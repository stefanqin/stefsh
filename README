Welcome to stefshv1.0!

This is a simple shell implementation of the Bourne-Again-Shell with very limited job control.
Built-in commands include "echo, cd, help, exit".

This was a personal project to integrate my knowledge of regular expressions, C, and multi-process programming.
It supports quotations - single and double - to group commands, as in: command "multiple commands here".
It supports backslashes to escape quotations and other backslashes in commands.

Happy shell hacking!
