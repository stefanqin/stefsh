<b>What is stefsh?</b>

This is a simple shell implementation of the Bourne-Again-Shell with very limited job control.
Built-in commands include "echo, cd, help, exit".

This was a personal project to integrate my knowledge of regular expressions, C, and multi-process programming.
It supports quotations - single and double - to group commands, as in: command "multiple commands here".
It supports backslashes to escape quotations and other backslashes in commands.

<b>Requirements</b>
Please install the PCRE2 library from [here](http://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2.html) before running the program.

<b>Contact</b>
Please contact Stefan @ cn.linkedin.com/in/stefanqin if you find any bugs.

Happy shell hacking!
